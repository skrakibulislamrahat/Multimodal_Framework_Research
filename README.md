This repository contains the full implementation for the research paper:

**"Explainable Deep Learning Framework for Early Detection of Diabetic Retinopathy in Retinal Imaging: A Scalable Approach for Clinical and Rural Deployment"**  
_A solo-author study by SK Rakib Ul Islam Rahat_

## 🧠 Overview

This project presents a multimodal and explainable deep learning framework that combines:

- **High-resolution fundus images** (from APTOS 2019)
- **Simulated clinical metadata** (age, HbA1c, BP, BMI, etc.)
- **EfficientNetB0** for image feature extraction
- **MLP** for metadata fusion
- **Grad-CAM** and **SHAP** for interpretability

The model is evaluated through:
- ✅ 5-fold cross-validation (APTOS)
- ✅ External validation (Messidor-2)
- ✅ Grad-CAM & SHAP visualizations
